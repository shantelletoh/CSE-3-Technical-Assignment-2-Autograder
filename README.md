# Grading Script for CSE 3 Technical Assignment #2: Website in HTML


## Running

1. **Clone** this repo.

2. On the **Canvas** page for Technical Assignment #2, click "**Download Submissions**".

3. Create a folder called **`TA2_Submissions`** inside your cloned repo. Copy all the files inside the zipped submissions folder into the **`TA2_Submissions`** folder.

5. In your **terminal**, **in the cloned repo**, enter **``python ta2_grading_script.py``**.

3. The script creates a spreadsheet called **`cse3_ta2_student_scores.xlsx`**, which contains:
    - **Total Scores** for each student's assignment
    - **Student Feedback** for the score breakdowns that the grader can simply copy and paste in the Comments field on Canvas.
    - **Note to TA/Grader** for anything the grader should manually check/look out for (e.g. script docks points for late submission but maybe the student should excused from it, incorrect file submitted, total score <= 700, etc.).

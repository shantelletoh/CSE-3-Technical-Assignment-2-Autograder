# Grading Script for CSE 3 Technical Assignment #2: Website in HTML


## Running

1. Clone this repo.

2. On the Canvas page for Technical Assignment #2, click "**Download Submissions**"

3. Create a folder called `TA2_Submissions` inside your cloned repo. Copy all the files inside the zipped submissions folder into the `TA2_Submissions` folder

5. In your terminal, in the cloned repo, enter ```python ta2_grading_script.py```

3. All of the student **scores** for the assignment are outputted into a newly created **`student_scores.csv`** file. `student_scores.csv` also contains:
    - **Student Feedback** that the grader can simply copy and paste in the Comments field on Canvas
    - **Note to the grader** for anything the grader should manually check/look out for (e.g. script docks points for late submission but maybe the student was excused from it, incorrect file submitted, or total score <= 700, etc.)
